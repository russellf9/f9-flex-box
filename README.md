A repository for my study of Flex Box

## CSS Positioning

Vertical and horizontal alignment is a corner stone of CSS UI. Rather than at this stage, go back to the old ways I thought I should focus on the current best technology.

Of course flex-box isn't fully backward compatible, but if my focus is mobile development then this is definitely the course to take.

And, flex-box seems more like the "semantic-web" rather than using tables or negative margins, not forgetting it's very much loke Flex!

There are some Safari webkit [compatibility issues](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox) which are easily fixed by using the <code>-webkit</code> prefix. Which in turn will lead e to using [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) or another pre-compiler.

(This I would do with Gulp [gulp-ruby-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-ruby-sass) - see: [A Beginners Guide to the Task Runner Gulp](http://andy-carter.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-task-runner-gulp) )
